## Takeaways

- In this project, I taught myself how to use Node.js and REACT to create a frontend web application. 
- I learned how to use access tokens and about network security. 
- I created a login page, a search bar, and a playback tab. 
- When the song plays, the app fetches lyrical data and displays the lyrics to the track as it plays.
